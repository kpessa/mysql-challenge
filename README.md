## Installation
Start by executing <code>npm run install</code> in the terminal.

## Usage
To create and seed the database as well as run, execute <code>npm run all</code> into the terminal.  You will be prompted for your mysql password for the root user twice.  Once for the schema.sql file and once for the seed.sql file.  Alternatively, you can run <code>npm run migrate</code>, <code>npm run seed</code>, <code>npm run start</code> to run each command in succession to start the node application.
